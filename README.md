# research_project
Code for my research project.

The results can be generated by the files car_data_experiment, metro_data_experiment and communities (.ipynb) to perform the results on the car, metro and communities data sets respectively.
An output file (.csv) with the results is generated by these programs, which can be used in plot_(car|metro|community)_results to generate the graphs. 
For the additional experiments with different variance, the values in the experiment files need to be changed.
For the additional experiment with variyng percentages, the Quantitative files are used which work the same, but only vary the percentage instead of the variance.
The results for these experiments can also be visualized in the plot files (by changing some values).
